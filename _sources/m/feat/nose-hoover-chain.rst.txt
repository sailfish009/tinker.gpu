Extended Nos√©-Hoover Chain by MTK
=================================

An isothermal-isobaric integrator described by MTK [#Martyna1996]_ was implemented.
In this paper, different methods for NVT and NPT ensembles were discussed.

======  ===============  ======
Number  Sections in MTK  Method
======  ===============  ======
1a      2.1 4.3          NVT
2a      2.2 4.4          NPT (isotropic cell fluctuations)
3a      2.3 4.5          NPT (full cell fluctuations)
4a      5.2              XO-RESPA
4b      5.2              XI-RESPA
1b      5.3              RESPA 1a
2b      5.4              RESPA 2a
3b      5.4              RESPA 3a
======  ===============  ======

Unlike the canonical Tinker where #2a has been implemented, the integrator
was implemented as the combination of NPT and XO-RESPA (#4a and #2b).
